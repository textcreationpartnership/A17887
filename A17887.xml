            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt that this litle worke, was the fruite of one of his Spirituall Retraites. The Manna which he gathered in the Sacred Deſert of Penance. A child of Prayer rather then of ſtudie; begotten at the foote of the Croſſe: brought out in the aboundance of his hart: ſpeaking to the hart rather then to eare. Thence he deſires
<pb facs="tcp:7957:7"/>the hart may rather pervſe it then the ey, at leaſt that it may be eyed in pietie, feare and ſimplicitie of hart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that, though he were preuented (howbeit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge) in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, by two moſt excellent pens, DREXELIVS, and LA SERRE, yet he falls in with nether of them, but walkes a midle way: for leauing the firſt in his diligent ſearch of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; the ſecond, in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, eleuations of mynd, motions, and rich amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he applies himſelfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the meditation, or ſimple Contemplation of Eternitie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7957:8"/>
            <p> Thirdly that in the verſion of diuers paſſages of the holy Fathers &amp;c. he was not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in tying himſelfe to their tearmes (their ſenſe was his ayme: in that he is faithfull) Say the like of holy Scripture. Hence the Tranſlatour will craue pardon, if faithfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his authour, he giue not alwayes the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though he marke it in another letter, to bring more light and life to the reading, While the humble maieſtie therof, is, at leaſt, pointed at.</p>

Shall I ſpeake in a word what is the <hi>Remora,</hi> which ſtops the shippe of our hearts, vnder the ſayles of our deſires ſayling towards Eternitie? it is, that euery one ſeekes himſelfe, and not the glorie of God.

Verily if we forme a iudgement of Faith by workes, as the ſcripture teacheth vs, it will eaſily be gathered by the fruite the world brings out, that there is nether Truth, nor Faith, nor Memorie of Gods iuſtice, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, left in the heart of man. All erre from their mothers wombe, and ſtray from the pathes of equitie, being <hi>heauie hearted,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſlow to beleeue</hi> that which is taught them by faith touching things to come. <hi>They loue vanitie, and ſeeke after falſitie and lyes.</hi> ô how deceitfull are the children of men in their <hi>waightes,</hi> ſuffering

Faith tells vs many glorious things of the Citie of God, where he raignes eternally with his Elect, where he makes his loue take roote as in a fertile feild. It tells vs, that this <hi>Kingdome is of all ages;</hi> that all <hi>the Bleſſed are Kings; heires of God, and coheires with Ieſus Christ.</hi> That God is there, <hi>all in all</hi> filling them with an eternall felicitie: that his power is an <hi>eternall powre:</hi> That <hi>his Kingdome shall haue no end.</hi> And in our Crede we proteſt, that <hi>we beleeue life euerlasting</hi> the life of the world to come, That ſuch as doe well shall enter into the bleſſed Eternitie; and the wicked into an eternall torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

Nay rather let vs apply vnto it, that which the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſopher applyed vnto the Diuinitie, that Eternitie is a circle, whoſe center is extended euerie where, and whoſe circunference hath no bounds. O Eternitie cryes

Though a man ſpeake all he is able, yet can he not ſufficiently expreſſe thee, euen to repreſent the leaſt ſtroke of thyne infinitie. Birdes, although they cannot ſoare to the

So that, if for the thicknes of this ſmoake, and the blackneſſe of theſe obſcurities, the priuation of the vſe of this ſenſe be an irkeſome torment vnto them: the short vſe, which at tymes they shall haue of it, will onely ſerue to add to their torment, alwayes vnfortunate both blind and ſeeing.

               <head type="sub">XXX.</head>
               <p>BVt amongſt all thoſe euils, Diuinitie teacheth vs, that none is comparable to that which is called the <hi>paine of damni,</hi> whence <hi>damnation,</hi> and the <hi>damned</hi> take their names. No, not all the exteriour ones, nor yet all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ones, which breefly we haue repreſented, can any way enter into compariſon with this, which alone, doth further ſurpaſſe them all in greatneſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the higheſt celeſtiall ſpheere, doth ſurmount this earthly globe. Which I will endeauour, to make you vnderſtand, Athanaſia, by this conſideration. In ſinne there are two principale malices, the firſt, is the auerſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Creatour; the other, is the conuerſion to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which God declares by the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7957:78"/>mouth of his Prophete in theſe words: <hi>my people at once committ two euills, they forſake me, who an the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of liue-water, and they make vnto them ſelues broken Cisternes which can hold no water.</hi> To this ſecond malice, belongs that paine of Senſe, whoſe miſeries we expreſſed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedant ſtroke: but to the abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creatour, appertaines the paine of <hi>damni,</hi> which conſiſts in the eternall priuation of the ſight of God, wherin is placed the higheſt point of the immortall beatitude. Now, <hi>I apprehend,</hi> ſaith the Father with the golden mouth, <hi>that part of glorie incomparably more great then all the other torments.</hi> And the ſame addes, <hi>that tenne thouſand torments like to thoſe of the damned are nothing being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to this priuation.</hi> Wherin this Doctor is followed of all the reſt, and the ſchoole doth teach it as a conſtant truth, which cannot be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7957:78"/>called in doubt, without shaking the grounds, and violating the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianitie. S. THOMAS ſtrikes further into it: for though the paine of <hi>damni</hi> be equall in all the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, and that of <hi>ſenſe</hi> vnequall, according to that which is written, <hi>that the torments are proportioned to the vnlawfull delights:</hi> and although as well thoſe of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> as of <hi>damni,</hi> be equall in reſpect of the Eternitie of their durance; yet doth he hold, that the <hi>paine of ſenſe,</hi> and that of <hi>damni,</hi> doe differ almoſt as much as a finite and infinite thinge: for certaine it is, that touching the ſenſes, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the reprobate comes far short of their demerits, <hi>the Diuine goodneſſe not being able to conteyne his mercy, euen in the effects of his greatest wroth:</hi> but as for the loſſe of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good, wher in the <hi>paine of damni</hi> doth conſiſte, who ſees not, that this punishment is in ſome ſort infinite?
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7957:79"/>And if inſenſible thinges find no reſt till they be reunited vnto their Center, ſince they were not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it but by violence; how intolerable muſt the ſtate needs be which doth ſeparate a ſoule for euer from its true principle, which is God, without all hope of returne. O rebellious Abſalomes! for an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie you shall be banished from the Court of this heauenly Father, who doth no longer accnowledge you for his children! Prodigalls that you are, who by your reuoults and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſtneſſe haue diſſipated the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this eternall Fathers grace: then shall there be no more tyme of repentance left for you: and in this perpetuall ſeparation from his face, you shall remayne for an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in that forraine land couered with the shadow of death, becauſe you did wilfully ſeparate your ſelues from the Authour of life. <hi>God will
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7957:79"/>reiect you eternally, eternally shall you be depriued of the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> and of the light of that glorie, which is the <hi>part and portion of the Bleſſed.</hi> For euer shall you lament the loſſe of this priſeleſſe treaſure; as <hi>Michol</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teares, and could not be comforted for the loſſe of her Gods. You shall ſob, but in vaine, in vaine shall you moane the loſſe of the God of Gods, whoſe deare preſence had as throughly replenished you with happineſſe, as his abſence doth oppreſſe you with diſaſter.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7957:80"/>they are, and what they might haue bene; and for what dolours they haue changed the inconceaueable felicities, which were prepared for them in the ſight of God; the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe repentance of their follie, will ſo vexe them, that thence shall ſpring thoſe <hi>teares,</hi> thoſe <hi>gnashings of teeth,</hi> and thoſe <hi>groanings,</hi> which the ſcriptures doe allote the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thence that <hi>immortall worme,</hi> which inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly shall gnaw them, mentioned by ISAY, a worme which S.

For this greife ryſing from the remembrance of their ſinne which is the cauſe of all their euils, and of ſo deplorable a priuation of the ſight
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7957:80"/>of God, shall liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in their memorie, and shall cauſe a sharper remorſe in them then all their other tortures. When they shall call to mynd ſo many ſecreete inſpirations, ſo many exteriour exhortations, ſo many interiour motions, which they had felt, to reclayme them from their wicked wayes; when they shall reflect vpon tyme miſpent and loſt, which they might haue made vſe of for their conuerſion, and for the redeeming of their vnfortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely ſpent dayes. When they shall repreſent vnto their thoughts, how often they were warned to forſake the <hi>wayes of ſinners,</hi> and not to ſitt in the <hi>chaire of peſtilence,</hi> to which they turnd a deafe eare and would not vnderſtand welldoing. And when they shall come to contemplate the vnfortunate eſtate, to which the contempt of ſo many remonſtrances shall haue reduced them, together
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7957:81"/>with their neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in not making vſe of occaſions paſt, which will neuer more preſent themſelues vnto them: ô God! with how fruitleſſe an abomination of their crimes, and with how furious and mad an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation shall they be tranſported? But lets rather heare them in their owne words, expreſſt by the holy Ghoſt in the booke of wiſdome, where he brings them in, ſpeaking in this ſort. <hi>We haue strayed and wandred from the wayes of truth, nor haue we bene enlightened with the light of Iustice. The Sunne of vnderſtanding hath not cast his beames vpon vs,</hi> where you are to note by the way, that theſe children of the Diuell ſpeake thus, following their Father's ſpirit, which is the ſpirit of Lies, ſince ſufficient grace to be ſaued, and neceſſarie light to deſcerne what is good, is denyed no man, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that all should be ſaued, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7957:81"/>should come to the knowledge of truth. But let vs heare the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe vniuſte plaintes. <hi>We gaue our ſelues ouer to the wayes of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and to the pathes of our ruine; we haue wandered in painefull wayes, being ignorant of the pathes of our Lord.</hi> Here you ſee how they mixe cokle with the good corne, wheate with Chaffe, I meane, they mixe truth with falſities, putting darkneſſe for light: For true it is, the way of vice is painefull and loathſome, and to ſpeake with the Prophete, <hi>it is beſett with thornes:</hi> but it is moſt falſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they knew not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine pleaſure, ſince the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the light of Faith, MOY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES <hi>and the Prophetes</hi> doe more then ſufficiently point it out; wherin they offend doublely in ſeeking to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their ſinnes, and become ſo much more lyable to punishment, that hauing knowen the will of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7957:82"/>their great maiſter they did it not. Let vs cloſely follow the grones of the reprobate, and ſee how the Racke compells them at length to confeſſe the truth: <hi>what hath pride profited vs; what aduantage haue we gotten by the vanitie of riches? all that, is past as a shadow; as a Poste, that rides at full speede; as a shippe ſayling on the ſea vnder full ſayles, leauing behind her no markes of her paſſage: as a bird ſwinning in the ayre, whoſe trace is not found; as an arrow which flying cutts the ayre, and the ayre preſently reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites it ſelfe. So haue our dayes run by, without leauing any marke of vertue: we haue spent in malice, all the Tyme which was liberally bestowed vpon vs, to worke our ſaluation, in feare and trembling. We haue paſt the courſe of our age in apparences, and in the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and falſe follies of the world, and in an instant we are fallen into Hell.</hi> In this ſort, doe thoſe wretches gnawen
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7957:82"/>with a continuall ſorrow, vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably repent them ſelues, and grone vnder the preſſure and affliction of heart, which is the Hell of their Hell. How did the Egiptians, thinke you, greeue, who contemned IO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEPHES counſell to make their prouiſion of corne, during the ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares of plentie, which were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, that wheate was no more eſteemed then ſand, while, during thoſe others of famine, they were conſtrayned to giue the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things they had, yea euen their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>owne libertie, leaſt famine might driue their ſoules out of their bodies. What a liuely ſenſe of greife shall they be touched withall, while they shall conſider, that their former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance cauſed in them many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and that their preſent want is the punishment of the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: but eſpecially when they shall ſee PHARAO made Maiſter
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7957:83"/>of all their goodes, as well moueable as immoueable, and that of his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſubiectes, they are become his ſlaues. O how heartily they would haue wished that they had giuen credit to the good IOSEPHES prophicies, who aduiſed them to be myndfull in their plentie, of the hard tyme to come, and to make good prouiſion in tyme of harneſt, while their granaries and Cellers ouerflowed on euery ſide. But how light is this temporall miſerie if it be compared to the eternall ſorrow which shall torment the reprobate, aduertiſed by ſo many remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well by writing as by word of mouth, which bett vpon their eyes and eares, and made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, in not hauing redeemed loſt tyme; and in hauing, by the hardneſſe <hi>and inpenitence of their heart, heaped vp a treaſure of anger, in the day of our Lords anger.</hi> What a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7957:83"/>remorſe shall they feele, to ſee that their wounds waxe old in the face of their imprudence. And that while they might haue purchaſed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and priſeleſſe felicitie for a glaſſe of cold water giuen in the loue, and for the loue of God; yea haue borne away the crowne of glorie, by naturall and neceſſarie actions being done in grace with conformitie to Gods will (at ſo eaſie a rate doth the ſupreame Goodneſſe ſell heauen!) and that theſe truthes were ſo frequently propoſed vnto them by the Ghoſpell, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers therof, who as trumpets made them reſound in their eares, they not being moued with all this, leſſe ſenſible then the walls of Hierico, who fell at the ſound of the preſtly trumpett. What a heart-breake it shall be vnto them to thinke how litle they inioyed, and for how litle a ſpace they poſſeſſed the ſame:

To ſpeake the truth, as there is no head ſo ſtrong that turnes not, nor body ſo ſtiddie that shakes not, at the aſpect of a deepe deſcent; ſo me thinkes, there is no braine that is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, by bending its atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion towards the eternall ſorrow, which shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly gnaw vpon thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable catiues.</p>

But alas! in ſaying <hi>neuer,</hi> we ſay a terme without terme, and which, for the tyme to come, shall continue as long as God shall be God. The Reprobate, ſaith the ſacred texte, shall be forſaken of God eternally. Eternally shall God be angrie with them, and that without reconcilement. This Abiſſe neuer renders any thing it once ſwallowes vp, the ſoules that are once caſt headlong thither, neuer returne. Out of that Gaole there is no redemption.

There, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, are the damned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of death, no otherwiſe then sheepe doe graſe: for as the graſſe putts vp againe vnder the sheepes nibling tooth, ſo shall the reprobate be continually ſtruke with the ſting of a liuing death, and ſtill as they shall be deuoured by it, they shall reuiue to new punishments, wherin the truth of that shall be ſeene, which the Poetes did onely fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly relate of the liuer ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, as by the vultour it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured. <hi>The wicked,</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſpell, <hi>shall be caſt into the fire, and they burne,</hi> in ſteed of ſaying <hi>they shall burne.</hi> A wonderfull ſpeech,

No, for Eternitie being, a perpetuall <hi>To-day,</hi> and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance remayning ſtill in the ſame beeing; how can that run by, which ſtands ſtill in the ſame ſtate? And if there be any thing new, it shall be the Canticles of ioy, which shall continually be new in the bliſſed Eternitie: In the accurſed, the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate shall ſuffer, and dayly shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend new ſufferances, and their ſenſe ſtill liuely, shall neuer be hardened therby.

Lets call to mynd, ſaith S. PACION, that in Hell there is no place left for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For the tyme therof is paſt. Happie is he who by a good confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion foreruns the face of the Iudge iuſtly irritated with our crymes: who doth promptly performe all the good in this world, which his hand is able to worke. And who doth well in euery thing, while in this life precious tyme is lent him. For now it is the houre to riſe from the ſleepe of the death of ſinne: for our ſaluation or da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation are neerer then we beleeue.

For their death shall be ſtill liuing; their end shall still be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining; and their tearme shall neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Death shall stifle without killing them. The Torture shall bruſe without diſtroying them. The flame shall burne them, without affording light at all; for this fire shall be darke; and horrour shall inhabit this darkneſſe; and darkneſſe shall increaſe the torment of the flame. Thus shall they be ſett vpon with the ſenſe of dolour and horrour; inceſſantly ſuffering and dreading.</hi> S.

For what did their glorie and vanitie ſerue them, what benefit did they reape of their tranſitorie ioyes? what aduantage did their great powre bringe them? ſay, what hath their foule pleaſures, and abundance of wealth left them? To what a low ebbe is their ſoaring ambition reduced! Alas the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of their ioyes was followed with teares and gnashings of teeth,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7957:87"/>which shall neuer haue end: and out of their short delightes, they are falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, rigourous beyond meaſure, and long without end. From the mouth of theſe <hi>two or three</hi> reprochleſſe <hi>witneſſes,</hi> let vs draw this <hi>word</hi> of Truth, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Eternitie of theſe paynes of Hell, puts vpon them the ſeale or marke of Infinitie, ſince one shall neuer ſee an end of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, or of their intiere conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

               <p>BVt in recompence hereof, I was wonderfully moued with the conſideration of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inconceaueable deſpaire, which the Sight of this horrible Eternitie of paines shall cauſe in the hartes of the damned. And truly, as the worme which eates the aple, is bred in the ſelfe ſame fruite, ſo shall this eternall deſpaire, like to a gnawing worme, iſſue out of the ſelfe ſame Eternitie whence it doth ſpringe. True it is that the torments which the damned shall ſuffer in all the members of their body, and in all the faculties of their ſoule, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame. Yet the conſideration that they shall neuer haue end, adds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother extreamitie to this extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which paſſeth imagination, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7957:89"/>which will incite theſe accurſed wretches, fallen into a reprobate ſenſe, to open their mouth againſt Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to horrible blaſphemies againſt God, as much, or more, then the ſenſe of their punishments? And if the Prophete ſaid, that he would cry like a dragon, and grone like an o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>trige, ouer the deſperate and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wounds of Iſrael, how much more terrible shall the how lings of the reprobate be, animated with a ſpirit of deſpaire and rage, in ſeeing their calamities voyde of all hope of redreſſe? So that it is the opinion of ALBERT THE GREAT, and DENIS THE CARTHVSIAN, that this thought of Eternitie, shall much more afflict them, then all the paines of their tortures. Which the great S. AVGVSTINE expreſſeth in theſe termes. Being tormented without interruption or end, they shall liue depriued of all hope of pardon, all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7957:89"/>expectation of mercy, wherin doth conſiſte the greateſt of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. For if they could but hope that their torments would haue end, after ſo many millions of yeares as all the creatures, euen to the worlds end, shall haue had haires on their head, be this number as great and incredible as it will, yet is it finite, and this imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an end would in ſome ſort ſolace their ſufferances. But wheras there is no end propoſed vnto them, they giue themſelues ouer to deſpaire, and impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth double their paines. This moued the Prophete to ſay that their worme shall not die, and their fire shall neuer be extinguished, neuer be conſumed, becauſe this worme of deſpaire shall torture their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, while the flame burns their body: being moſt reaſonable, that thoſe who with body and ſoule offended an eternall God, should be

               <p>THis ſo dreadfull deſpaire, shall yet be augmented, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſia, by a conſideration which I find, no leſſe ſingular, then remarkable: to wit, that thoſe paines shall not onely be eternall, but alſo without intermiſſion. For the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned shall not onely paſſe in an inſtant, from one extreamitie to another, and as IOB ſaith, from froſen waters, to deuouring fires, but their torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts shall be continuall, and continually in a point vnſufferable, and without intermiſſion at all. No part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or abatement of paines are there to be hoped. T'is a warre that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7957:90"/>shall neuer haue truce. In the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of this life, be they neuer ſo great, there is alwayes ſome mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or place to breath in; in that they ſtay not ſtill in the ſame ſtate. As the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doe inceſſantly rowle: So all that is vnder thoſe rowleing ſpheeres, are obnoxious to changes and reuolutions. The ſeaſons doe continually change, and continually renew the face of the vniuers. The Moone increaſeth and decreaſeth. The Sunne doth aduance it ſelfe, or put it ſelfe in a greater diſtance from vs. The ſea hath its ebb and flowing: and the ſprings, riuers, and floods, run day and night to find the Sea. Man's age runs dayly to decay. Kingdomes and Empires, haue their tymes to florish and fade. Deſeaſes are lightned, in that they come but by fits, and by the hope we haue to end, or mend. In aduerſe fortune we are comforted, by expectation to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7957:91"/>find her fauorable. The sharpeſt and moſt violent ſickneſſe, hath its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terualls, &amp; qualifications. Sleepe is the comon charme of greeues, and often by its dreames, it rayſeth the condition of the moſt miſerable (for the ſpace it continewes), aboue the happines of the moſt happie. But in Hell, ſleepe flyes from the ey-lids of the reprobate, nor doth reſt, ſeiourne neere vnto them. Their teares doe neuer dry vp: their Ague is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall, and without intermiſſion. Without relaxatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they dy in liuing; without relaxation, they liue in dying. And if a rayne continuing for 40. dayes onely, was able to drowne the whole world: ô God what a Deluge of miſeries shall choke thoſe miſerable ſoules, vpon whom, without releaſe, floods of fire, and darts of furie and maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, shall showre downe. And if things moſt aggreeable, turne diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

What shall it be I pray you, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to ly extended, vpon incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueably hote burning coales, and amongſt execrable ſtinches, and all the torments that can be imagined, without repoſe, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, without hope, and without releaſe, for a whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, O you that are deafe, ſaith ISAYE, harke; ô you blind, behold!

I adore them great God, yea my ſoule caſt vpon the earth, and my mouth ioyned to the duſt, I confeſſe that all thou doſt, proceeds from a true and iuſt iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; and that all thy wayes are replenished with iuſtice. For who am I duſt and ashes, a worme and not a man, to enter a diſpute with thee? Who if thou wouldſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and examine our faults, who is able to ſuſtayne thy face, and to enter into iudgment with thee? Yet as thou art ſoueraignely Good, thou permitſt men to diſcuſſe matters
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7957:98"/>with thee. And being Truth it ſelfe, thou art willing, that they should propoſe vnto thee the things they conceaue to be iuſt and true. In this Confidence, ô Lord, approching towards the Throne of thy mercy, after the conſideration of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall paynes I haue now contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, I hope thou wilt permit my poore ſoule to make a weake ſallie towards thee. Lord thoſe ſoules which thou doſt banish, to thoſe endleſſe flames, which deriue all their heate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fire of thy wroth, are they not the workmanshipe of thy hands? And is not thy worke mercy it ſelfe, as thy nature is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe? Why then doſt thou shut thy eares to their cryes, and of a pitifull Father, to thoſe accurſed ſoules, thou becomeſt, an inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſeuere, I dare not ſay, a cruell Iudge, as thy ſeruant IOB tearmes thee, whom thou didſt try
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7957:98"/>in manifold ſufferances? <hi>Where are thyne aunient mercyes ô Lord?</hi> haſt thou forgotten to pardon, which is thyne ordinarie couſtume? Why, haſt thou reiected them for euer, and can they neuer appeaſe thy anger? Ah! no Lord they know well, that which they demande is not for thy glorie; they that haue bene prodigall of thy fauours; that are not worthy to be called thy children, that can pretend nothing in the inheritance of ſaluation, nor in the portion replenished with light reſerued to thy Saints. Their deeds of darkneſſe hath rendred them vnworthy of that bright day which knowes no night. Being no longer thy children, they cannot be heires of thy Sanctuarie; heires of the Land of the liuing; nor <hi>coheires with</hi> IESVS CHRIST whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood, and merits, they haue troden vnder their feete. Nay Lord,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7957:99"/>euen they, doe not demande to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of Hell, nor to be freed from thoſe paynes, which are iuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon them; for to appeare before thy wrothfull face, would be a hell and a Torture vnto them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more rigorous then all the torments they endure. Their onely deſire is to be reduced to nothing, ſince they haue commit the works of ſinne; which is a true nothing. But if thou daigne them vnworthy of this vnfortunate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, at leaſt after many ages of paines, can they not expect ſome moment of releaſe? shall not ſome litle drope of refreshment and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, after many thouſand of yeares, be ſent to water their withered lipps, their thirſting throtes, their burning tongues? Say Lord, wilt thou for euer laugh at their liuing death? Wilt thou not for euer bow to their begging? <hi>O the God of my heart! ô the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7957:99"/>part of myne euerlasting inheritance!</hi> What's this that I heare in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of my heart? what dradfull Echo makes reſound therin theſe words of horrour? <hi>I will be inexorable vnto them eternally.</hi> Softly, my ſoule, make a ſtand here, ſtep not a foote further. Doſt thou not ſee the firie ſword in the Diuine Iuſtice's hand, threatening ouer thy head, if thou aduance a foote. Doſt belonge to thee temerarious wretch, <hi>to ſound God's Maieſtie?</hi> Feareſt thou not, to be <hi>ouerwhelmed with his glorie?</hi> Doſt thou not ſee that theſe reprobates are relinquished by the ſpirit of his heart, &amp; precipitated into an eternall obliuion in this <hi>ſecond death?</hi> Leaue them there then, and kiſſing the ſonne, that is, adoring the highneſſe of the Scepter of this Diuine Iuſtice, reioyce together with the iuſte in this iuſte reuenge: and wash thy hands in the ruine, and bloode of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7957:100"/>thoſe ſinners. And drawing light from their darkneſſe, compound a wholſome treackle of the venime of their infelicitie. Caſt thyne eyes rather vpon the malice of ſinne, and by an effect ſo horrible, forme a iudgment of the greatneſſe of the Cauſe. Thinke if thou ſeeſt a louing Father iuſtly caſting his ſonne into a burning fornace; that thence thou oughtſt to coniecture an enormious crime in the child; as well by reaſon of the greeuiouſneſſe of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as by the Fathers rigour. ô Eternall Father, whoſe mercies are numberleſſe, what an inward hate muſt thou needs conceaue againſt the vniuſt, and iniuſtice; ſince thou doſt punish ſo rigorouſly, and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, the ſoules thou bought at ſo great a price; as is the bloode of thyne owne ſonne, blood <hi>which cryed better then that of Abel,</hi> bloode able to fetch out any ſtayne, to wash of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7957:100"/>all offences, and to render them sknowie white, whom ſinne had made cole-blacke, ſo that this ISOPE, this ſopewort be applyed in a fitt tyme, in a tyme capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing this plentuous redemption. Where are our thoughts, ô my ſoule, how doth not dread put vs into a traunce, while ſinne preſents it ſelfe vnto our eyes, what a monſter muſt it needs be, for whom ſo darkſome a Dungeon and boiſterous tempeſt is prepared; and fince that God who is infinitly good, is irreconciliably irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated againſt thoſe reprobate ſoules? How oft, my poore heart, haue we merited thoſe horrible punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? waſt not as oft as we withdrew our ſelues from our dutie by mortall cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, ſinthens all the Diuels there were damned for one ſinne? And are they not then ſo many ſingular obligations we haue to God, who expected vs ſo long to repentance?
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7957:101"/>in not ſuffering his vengance to to take vs in the manure. If we ſlile the Doctors, who by their care and skill, recouere vs, out of a dangerous ſickneſſe, our Eſculapeſes. If a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie out of priſon draw ſuch an obligation vpon vs, towards the workers therof; If a Princes grace doe ſo much ingage vs to him; as likewiſe the fauour of being freed from fire or water, to our deliuerers. What shall we render to this good God, who, as often as we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, hath recouered vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, and death euerlaſting? Death whoſe torment, doth far ſurpaſſe, all that can be ſaid or thought of it. Propoſe vnto thy ſelfe, ô my ſoule, a thing that shall neuer happen, according to the order of the Diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Iuſtice, though otherwiſe poſſible to him that can doe all, that God had drawen out of this darke hole into which redemption enters
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7957:101"/>not, ſome one of the damned crue, to giue him tyme of repentance for his ſinns: and conſider what thankes he would render to his Creatour for ſo great a benefit; and how well he would husband this precious tyme, to regayne himſelfe out of the midſt of his dreadfull tortures. Now, my deare ſoule, thou muſt needes haue loſt all ſenſe and iudgment, if thou accnowledge not the benefit of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation to be no leſſe, then this imaginarie deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſince it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes thee from the ſame torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, merited by ſo many faults. Why doe not we then ſpend our ſelues in thankes giuing, why are we neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in redeeming loſt tyme, ſloathfull in running to the remedie of Penance. The onely Table of ſafetie after the shipwrake of grace? O God full of Goodnes, who deſires not the death of a ſinner, but his conuerſion and life. Ah! I begge this fauour of thee;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7957:102"/>that at leaſt I may performe ſome part of that, which he would doe, whom, by thyne extraordinarie power, and mercy without preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, thou migſteſt haue deliuered out of this Gulfe of horrour. Ah! Lord I know this onely part, would worke my whole penance: for neuer would myne eylidds waxe dry, the aples of myne eyes would euer ſwime in their fountaines, night and day should I weepe. My cheekes should alwayes be watered, and my teares should be my dayly bread. I would imbrace all ſorts of exteriour and interiour ſorow, to auoyd thoſe deuouring flammes, and the eternall rageings of that abominable Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, where thou art perpetually blaſphemed. O God my mercy! <hi>Saue me from the Iawes of thoſe roaring Lyons, prepared for their prey.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue me from before the sharpe hornes, of thoſe ſauage Vnicornes.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7957:102"/>Indew me, ô Lord, with the ſpirit of Compunction, and Penance, which is ſo neceſſarie to auoyde this Abiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. And thou, my ſoule, why doſt thou dwell vpon this thought of horrour, why art thou vexed in it? Lift vp thy heart and hope in the mercy of the Higheſt. I, thou shalt yet againe praiſe him, the tyme of his mercy is not expired to thee. He is the ſaluation of thy face, and thy true God: no no by his aſſiſtance and grace, thou shalt beare no part in the abominable blaſphemies of <hi>the region of the shadow of death:</hi> but thou shalt be aggreable vnto him, and shalt ſing his prayſes in <hi>the Land of the Liuing.</hi>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7957:110"/>Heauen called <hi>Empireall,</hi> that is to ſay of fire; not that it burnes, but by reaſon of the brightnes of its flame, and the ſplendour of its light. This higheſt Heauen was vnknowen to the auncient Aſtrologers, and is yet to the new, vnleſſe by the light of faith, reuealed by God to the Church and her Doctors. For the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, like to all thoſe that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of other mathematicall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, grownding onely vpon ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible demonſtrations, and making a iudgement of other places, by the diuers motions of the ſtarrs; and this that we ſpeake of being inuiſible and immoueable, is placed aboue the knowledge and lawes of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. It is then a firme, ſtable, ſolide and inuariably ſettled heauen, called in holy Scrip. <hi>The firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of heauen the heauen of Heauens, the Land of the liuing, the Seate and Throne of God:</hi> and in Geneſes, <hi>Heauen created from

In vaine doth S.

If we should here giue bridle to our conſideration, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our mynd to walke through the multitude of different creatures, which by their varietie doe ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the face of the vniuers, doe you not thinke, Athanaſia, that it would be a courſe of too long a breath, and ſuch, as was a ſubiect to ſo many, the pens of antiquitie, amongſt others S. BASILS, S. AMBROSES, and ORIGENS in their Exam. and the Expounders of Geneſis. Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues to draw from this ſpacious proſpect, this inference. If the world, a place of Nature, be a Stage, wherin is preſented ſo many pleaſant things: how rauishing shall thoſe beauties be, which God shall manifeſt vnto his friends in the Manſion of his glorie, the Paradice
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7957:114"/>of his delightes? If he permit the wicked, his enemies, ſuch as offend him, to inioy in this viſible world ſo many delightes and pleaſures; what will he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate to thoſe, whom he daignes to crowne with his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and eternall fauours, in the State of glorie? A Stoicall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſpeaking of the felicitie of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules, according to the light of nature, obſcured with the shadowes of Paganiſme, could ſay, that as much difference as there is, betwixt the dungeon of a womans wombe, and this great world; ſo much is there betweene the wonders of this heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly beatitude of vertuous ſoules departed from their bodies, and the greateſt beauties which are ſeene in heauen and earth. To what length are we to driue this diſſimilitude, we that are enlightened with the light of fayth, and taught by ſo many faithfull promiſes, as are contayned
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7957:114"/>in the Scripture touching this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and vnconceauable Eternitie. O Iſrael how goodly are thy taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, how delightfull thy Pauillions: gardens watered with floods and fountaines are not ſo florishing, nor are the vallies abounding with fruite, ſo aboundant. Theſe are the words of a Prophete, who yet doth but ſparingly expreſſe the delightes of this happie Abode: where the light is continuall, and the dayes without nightes, by reaſon of Gods preſence, who is wholy light, and who doth not ſuffer thoſe that doe follow and adore him, to remayne in darkneſſe. Wherevpon the ſpirits which doe ſerue before his Throne are called <hi>Angells of light.</hi> It is a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendant Reſidence, not ſtanding in need of thoſe tortches, the Sunne and Moone, which are onely made to giue light, to this low and elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie world, the heauenly Lambe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7957:115"/>being the <hi>Lampe, which doth lighten the eternall Sion.</hi> A Reſidence, where the flowres doe continually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignie the fruites, and where the extreamitie of heate and cold are banished, to make place to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable temperature, and farr other then that earthly Paradice (a garden of delight) wherin were placed our firſt Parents, created in originall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. A Reſidence in concluſion, wholy conſtant, and of an eternall durance. From whence death is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the qualities, ſubiect to bring in alteration and change, are banished; and where all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants shall in ſome ſort be made participant of the immutabilitie of God.

As when we reade, that eternall life, is to <hi>know one onely God,</hi>

And who would not gather hence, that it conſiſteth in the <hi>viſion,</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> of the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; God, who is infinitly greater then our harts, filling them both with vnimaginable delightes, being, in qualitie of <hi>Soueraigne Truth,</hi> the obiect of our <hi>vnderstanding,</hi> and as he is the <hi>Soueraigne Good,</hi> the obiect

Lets ſoberly content our ſelues with this ſmale reaſon. If the Bleſſed ſoule, did not imbrace the heauenly Spouſe in his glorie with both her armes, which are the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> doubtleſſe she would not be wholy ſatisfied: for who knowes not euen by experience, that the <hi>will</hi> is not carried with leſſe bent toward <hi>Good</hi> then the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> towards the <hi>Truth.</hi> Whence I gather, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily her deſire muſt be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all ſorts of good things, according as the Scripture doth teach vs, and the enſuing <hi>strokes</hi> will giue vs more amply to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7957:118"/>
                  <hi>eſſentiall Beatitude doth conſiste in the perfect vnion of the ſoule to God, being made,</hi> as the Apoſtle tearmes it, <hi>one ſelfe ſame spirit with him:</hi> which is done in the ſoule by Gods inward <hi>penetration,</hi> called by the Diuines, nor can we expreſſe it in any other terme, an <hi>illaps;</hi> which, me thinkes, vpon neceſſitie, we may make vſe of in our tongue, as well as of the word <hi>Relaps;</hi> finding that nether more rude, nor more improper then this, which is receaued, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by cuſtome. Now this <hi>illaps</hi> of God into the ſoule, doth replenish it with the glorie of God himſelfe, and doth as it were, deifie it, according as S. IOHN ſpeakes: we know that <hi>we shall be made like vnto him, when we shall ſee him, as he is.</hi> So that the ſoule shall be filled and replenished with God, as the Moone, when she is perfectly full, with the light of the Sunne: or as a ſponge when it is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7957:119"/>throughly wett, and filled with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. And God vniting himſelfe vnto her, as the fire is vnited to the burning iron, following the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platiues ordinarie ſimilitude, shall be ioyned vnto her, and shall vnite her ſo inly to himſelfe, that she shall be as it were transformed into God, who shall be, as ſaith the Spouſe in the Canticles, intirely hers, as she againe shall be intirely his. Which cauſed S.

                  </gap>, the Hebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <hi>Neſamah,</hi> for all theſe words, doe but ſignifie one and the ſame thing. Now to ſpeake onely in this place of the higheſt, God being Spirit, a moſt pure Act, and moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one eſſence, although in glorie he be vnited to euerie bleſſed ſoule, yet is his vnion more excellent, and eminent in this higheſt portion of the ſoule, then in thoſe below, euen as we obſerue in mans ſoule, which is all in all the body, and all in euery part therof, yet is more nobly, that is, it doth more nobly exerciſe its functions in the head, then in the other members of the bodie. So ſay the Miſtikes, that this higheſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man's ſoule is the Spouſe his bed, Salomon's coutch, his Cabinet, and the place of his more particular delights. Ther is the Diuine eſſence vnited to the eſſence of the ſoule;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7957:120"/>there the ſpirituall marriages (mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages the fullneſſe of our eternall felicitie) celebrated, wherof ſo much mention is made in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For as the Bridegroome and Bride are two in one flesh, by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred band which doth tye them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſo the Bleſſed ſoule, by this vnion with her Principle, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to her end, becomes one ſpirit with him, through the exceſſe of that Charitie, which is the band of all perfection. Thus is the ſoule transformed and transfigured into light by the ſpirit of God, made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipant of the Diuine nature, and conformable to the likneſſe of his Maieſtie. Tis true, that we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made to the likneſſe and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God, whoſe picture is ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely expreſt in the ſoule, which is one in Eſſence, and trine in faculties: Yet much more by grace, which makes vs, as it were, certaine look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7957:121"/>wherin that glorioule Sunne makes the rayes of his light and loue meete, while he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his perfections therin. Yet the Saints who are in glorie, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are marked with his ſplendour, and doe shine like the Sunne for perpetuall eternities, are yet incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more liuely pictures of the Diuinitie. For euen as the Sunne meeting with a thicke and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome cloude in the aire, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ſo deeply imprint its beames vpon its face, that it appeares ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sunne; ſo are the Bleſſed in Heauen ſo transformed into God, that they shewe as ſo many Gods, and as ſo many deareſt children of the Higheſt, as DAVID deliuers it. This excellent beautie, with which the Diuine preſence doth adorne them, was cauſe, that S. IOHN eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying an Angell, whom he tooke for God, had adored him, if that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7957:121"/>ſpirit, no leſſe humble then glorious bright, had not giuen him to know that he was his fellow-ſeruant.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7957:133"/>a thouſand worlds. And if the bleſſed ſoules were not ſatisfied and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as indeed they are, with this full, preſſed, and ouerheaped meaſure of felicitie falling into their heart: And if any kind of ſorrow could haue entire into a State ſo replenished with happines, this would it be, that they had not imployed all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of their life to make progreſſe in that vertue, which makes them ſo much more capable of the powre of our Lord, as it is found to haue bene more emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in them.

               <p>IT is no ſmale queſtion, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, to know how far the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding fortified with the <hi>light of Glorie,</hi> doth extend it ſelfe in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation of the Diuine Eſſence, which it beholds without all helpe of <hi>species</hi> or <hi>repreſentation.</hi> But the Angell of the ſchoole giues a worthy ſatisfaction to this holy curioſitie, in teaching vs that God, according to IEREMIE, being, by reaſon of his infinitie, incomprehenſible to euery created thought, can neuer be comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by any vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, with what euer <hi>light of Glorie</hi> they be adorned and aſſiſted. Becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery creature being bounded, is not capable to comprehend an infinite Obiect. Hence we haue that fine
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7957:135"/>and neceſſarie diſtinction, that the bleſſed shall ſee God, All indeed, but not totally; they shall ſee him all, becauſe being moſt ſimple, he cannot be ſeene but he is all ſeene. But againe, wheras he is infinite, there nether is, nor can be any capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie out of himſelfe which can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally comprehend him, nor imbrace that immenſe Infinitie, which is onely knowen of him ſelfe. Wee haue ſome ſemblance of this Truth, which cannot be ſeene, vnleſſe it be all ſeene, and yet is it neuer totally ſeene, though it be euen a limited creature, and hath nothing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Creatour. So doe the fish and fowles inioy the vaſt extent of the Sea and ayre, yet what fish did euer ſwime in all the waters; and what bird did euer with flight mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ayres extent? All this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is poſſible, becauſe it is finite. But the Diuinitie which is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7957:135"/>boundleſſe cannot be totally ſeene. For <hi>who did euer ſound the depth of ſuch an Abiſſe? And who hath euer knowen the ſenſe of our Lord?</hi> Herein is diſcouered the impertinencie of AETIVS and ENNANIVS old Heretikes, who affirmed that God could be comprehended by a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as though, forſooth, an illimited thing, could be shut vp within li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites. An impertinencie pertinently refuted by thoſe great lightes of the Church, S. BASILE, S. GREGORIE OF NAZIANZENE, S. CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOSTOME, S. AVGVSTINE, and after them, by the Angelicall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Yet this doth not impeach the full and intire ſatisfaction of the Bleſſed; nor doth the naturall inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie which they find in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to behold God totally, any white vexe them: yea contrariwiſe it doth augment their ioy and contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which hath no other of-ſpring then
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7957:136"/>the loue of God, <hi>a loue of friendshippe,</hi> which doth rather reſpect the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glorie of the obiect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, then its owne intereſt; what a pleaſing rauishment shall poſſeſſe them; to behold the moſt ſimple, onely, and incompoſed ſimplicitie of that Diuine beautie, which they contemplate, all, though not totally, by reaſon of its incomprehenſible infinitie? In beholding it, their deſire is filled with euery good thing: And beit they ſee it diuerſly, as we haue showen, yet are they throughly content, according to the comon ſimilitude of a glaſſe wherof the leaſt is as well filled with a litle, as the greateſt with much liquor. And after the deſire is ſaciated with the fruition of this ineffable <hi>Good,</hi> with what an exceſſe of ioy are they taken, to know, that this adorable Deitie hath an infinite compainie of other graces and perfections, ſtill
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7957:136"/>remayning to be ſeene &amp; relished, which are not totally comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded nor knowen, ſaue onely by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Man doth then rayſe himſelfe aboue himſelfe; and liftes vp his heart. But God, greater then all hearts, doth yet riſe higher, nor can he be enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſed by any other then himſelfe in his full extent. O how rauishing and admirable is that they behold! And how good cauſe haue they to ſing with the Angells the three <hi>Sanctuſes</hi> to ſo dreadfull a Maieſtie, in ſo high a ſtrayne, that the Gates of Heauen shall tremble at it; and to pronounce: Thou art great and exceeding laudable ô Lord; and who can worthily enough ſing thy excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in thy ſacred Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in thy holy mountaines? Though all creatures should ouerſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yea melt away in ioy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, yet shall they neuer arriue at the leaſt of thyne infinite excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7957:137"/>Hence it is that the HYMNE of ſilence is the beſt ſuiting praiſe, that can be offered vnto thee, in thy Heauenly Sion. Yet ô God, how much more admirable is that which thoſe ſoules doe not diſcouer in thee, ſince it ſurpaſſeth all created vnderſtandings, euen ſtrengthened with the <hi>light of Glorie?</hi> And to what a violent paine would the deſire of knowing thee totally, and louing thee deſeruedly, that is infinitly, put them vnto, if thy ſweete and fatherly prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, (leaſt the puritie of their inſpeakable ioyes might be ſtayned with the mixture of any diſcontent) did not change the knowledge they haue, that they cannot totally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and imbrace thee, into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne delight, that the glorious Obiect of their view and loue, is ſo immenſe, that it cannot be perfectly and intirely knowen and beloued, but by thy ſelfe, by reaſon of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7957:137"/>infinitie of thyne infinite Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Meane while they draw from this great ALL, as from an vndray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable fountaine, all their comon and particular delightes, diuerſely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, according to the diuerſitie of the <hi>light of Glorie</hi> which is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto them, wherby they ſee him more or leſſe, with proportion to their Charitie and merit. We haue ſome darke reſemblance of this here below in the vſe of our Senſes. For is it not true that the ſame Picture is diuerſely beholden, according to the varietie of their opinions and skill that doe behold it? Is not a daintie muſike diuerſely receaued into the eare of the hearer, according as their organes are diſpoſed, and they are attentiue vnto it? And to conclude this diſcourſe with an excellent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude: The miraculous MANNA which pleaſed euery palate, was doubtleſſe of a diuerſe relish to the

We may ſay the ſame of the ſight of God, the higheſt point of eternall Glorie: a ſight which S.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:7957:138"/>of the Schoole the Angelicall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, who teacheth vs, that like as no created vnderſtanding can totally comprehend God; ſo conſequently can it not ſee in God all that he doth, or is able to doe, that being reſerued to God alone, who is of an infinite capacitie, or rather infinitie it ſelfe. Marrie it shall ſee more or leſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the <hi>light of Glorie</hi> by which it is ſuſtayned.

Nor is it to the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to affirme, that the Bleſſed, who shall reſemble the Angells, shall ſee like thoſe heauenly ſpirits in the WORD (the true Mirrour without all Spot <hi>the likeneſſe of his Fathers
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7957:139"/>Goodnes, and figure of his ſubstance;</hi> the ſplendour and candour of his light, <hi>being God of God, and light of light.</hi>) All things as in a Mirrour, being a thing comonly knowen, that he that ſees a Mirrour, ſees all things repreſented therin. For to make that obiection vanish like ſmoake, we need onely to reply, that it is true indeed when we ſpeake of a Mirrour which is comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the eye. But this Mirrour of the WORD and the Diuinitie, being incomprehenſible, how can it be imagined, that a finit and limited vnderſtanding can comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that which is incomprehenſible? God therfore doth onely communicate himſelfe infinitly vnto himſelfe, by reaſon of the infinit capacitie which he hath to giue and receaue ſuch a communication: To creatures it is ſufficient that he communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with proportion to their ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie

For how can they iuſtly deſire any more, after they be replenished with the <hi>fulneſſe of God</hi> ſo far forth as their capacitie and abilitie can admitt? But let vs conſider further, Athanaſia, how excellent this ſight of things in God shall be, by the manner of ſeeing, which shall be much more perfect then though they were ſeene in themſelues, in their nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, or els by their <hi>ſpecies</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.

Ordinarily theſe <hi>Aureolae</hi> are diuided into three kindes; wherof one is attributed to MARTYRES, who haue conquered the world: the ſecond to VIRGINES, who haue ſurmounted ſenſualitie: the third to DOCTORS, who by their learning haue defeated the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7957:156"/>Artes and errours of the Prince of darkneſſe. And if theſe <hi>Aureolae</hi> be compared together, the comon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent giues the firſt rancke and pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minencie to Martyrdome: for there is no greater charitie, then to giue ones life for that which he loues. Neuer durſt any, ſaith S. AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE, preferre Virginitie before Martyrdome, Chaſtitie being but a lent martyrdome, wheras to die in torments, is a violent one. A ſecond is giuen to virgines, who follow the Lambe where euer he goes, clothed in white ſtoles. The third to Doctors, who were <hi>the ſalte of the earth, the light of the world, and the Lampes of Iſrael.</hi> And when I ſay the <hi>Aureola</hi> shall be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Doctors, I nether vnderſtand the learned, nor thoſe that shall onely haue taken the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Doctor ship in earth, and <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their Talent,</hi> and hid their Lampe vnder the Bushall: For ſuch Doctors

For as he is not crowned who hath onely the abilitie and ſtrength to fight and vanquish, but he that in effect doth fight and ouercome the enemy, according to that: <hi>none shall be crowned, but ſuch as haue lawfully fought:</hi> ſo thoſe onely that had knowledge, &amp; made others participant of it, shall partake of the <hi>Aureola</hi> of Doctors, according to that of the Ghoſpell, he that shall teach and doe what is good, shall

Though God be ſole and one in Eſſence, yet hath he ſocietie in the diſtinctions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and thence is not ſolitarie in his Beatitude. What shall it be to behold the Societie of the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine perſons vnited together in the vnitie of their beeing? yea euen to be vnited to this high Societie, in the band of Charitie, which is that of perfection! what shall it be to be aſſociated to the humanitie of IESVS CHRIST, our brother, according to Flesh, as he was Sonne of man,

O how happie shall they be who are inrowled into the holy FELLOWSHIPE of IESVS CHRIST, and made partaker of his heauenly and Diuine conuerſation? And if it be written, that euen in this world, he that is in Charitie, remaynes in God, and God in him; and that he that keepes the Commandements, is made the Tabernacle, and lodginge, of the three perſons of the Sacred TRINITIE: what are we to ſay of the ſtate of conſummated Grace, which is Glorie, where Charitie is compleate? O Diuine Societie! And if after the Diuinitie and humanitie of our Sauiour, we turne the ey of our conſideration vpon the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beautie of her who is the holy

As for the Elect who are to ſucceede in the vacante Seates, and to repaire the ruines, of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells Apoſtataes, they shall be in ſo great abundance, that S.

By how much the place is higher, whither the Ape climes, by ſo much he is more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and for want of his tayle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers all his infamie: wheras vpon the ground his deformitie doth leſſe appeare. There are certaine great-ones whoſe ſcandalous proceedings,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7957:169"/>which would be couered in the throng, if they were but of a comon condition, ſeeme onely to appeare in the face of the Sunne, to faſten shame vpon their foreheades, to perceaue in themſelues ſuch abiect mynds, in qualities ſo high. Certes, ſaith the great Stoicke, imagine what greatnes you pleaſe in man, it neuer paſſeth the limites of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Though a man be mounted vpon a Throne, his ſtature is no greater for all that. To take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of a Statua, one is neuer to meaſure the Baſe: nor to take the hight of a man, doe we meaſure him with his dignitie, of which he is often vnworthy. He that is ſeated in a high ſeate, ſitts in the ſame manner that he would doe, being ſet in a lower place. Stiltes and footſtooles make not a man taller, though he appeare higher. A noble out-ſide doth not rayſe an abiect mynd; nor
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7957:169"/>doth the brighteſt luſter of nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, alwayes light vpon the greateſt head. There is nothing perfect here-below; there are no roſes without thornes, no wheate without cokle, nor corne without chaffe. This world is an Arke, wherin are cleane and vncleane beaſtes. A Parke wher goates and sheepe liue together. A nett wherin both good and bad fish are found. The rayne and Sunne doe equally fall and shine vpon the fruitfull and fruitleſſe ground. But in Heauen it fares not ſo; nothing that is ether impure or imperfect can haue entrie there. <hi>In that faire place,</hi> ſaith S.

Kings with all their Powre eſcape not its dart; nor doe Giants with all their force auoyd it. Herein appeares O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen's errour, who walking vpon the wings of the wind, perished (like to that old <hi>Milo Crotonienſis</hi>) by his owne ſtrength, while he was of opinion, that the Elect after a long reſidence in Heauen, should fall at length from that felicitie, like as he had held before that the paines of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned should not be eternall, one abſurditie drawing on another.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7957:181"/>that patience is the proofe <hi>of their</hi> Faith, and that the worke of <hi>Patience is perfect,</hi> that is, doth perfect him that doth it. <hi>Tribulation,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>worketh patience, and Patience probation, and probation Hope,</hi> and ſuch a hope, as <hi>confoundeth not</hi> in its expectation. Though we are now for a ſmale tyme to be afflicted with many tribulations, yet it is, that the tryall of our Faith may appeare more precious then gold before the face of God, who according to his great mercy doth regenerate vs by a liuely hope to poſſeſſe the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly inheritance, which cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nor changed. Then we shall behold, we shall admire; and the plentie of good things shall dilate our heart. Then with an incredible ioy we shall be drunke vp in God our SALVATION. Then the teares shall be wiped from the eyes of the Elect, they shall weepe no more,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7957:181"/>greife and paine shall no more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them, becauſe all that, is blowen ouer, that is to ſay, they entered not into thoſe eternall Bowres but through the fires and waters of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. Truly he were iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an vnworthy ſoldier, who would deſire to gaine victorie better cheape then his Capitaine: and how did our Capitaine and Law giuer IESVS CHRIST enter into the glorie which was due vnto him by nature? was it not by ſufferance? Let vs behold then the Exemplaire of the mountaine, but the mountaine of Caluarie, before we take into our conſideration, that of Thabor. Let vs looke vpon the Authour and Comſummatour of our faith, IESVS CHRIST, who chooſed to vndergoe the Croſſe, while glorie was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto him. Let vs imitate the Apoſtle who was ſo loyall to his Maiſter, that he bore in his bodie the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7957:182"/>ſtigmates and markes of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lord. O how ioyfull the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were, when it happened that they were to endure ſomething for the loue of CHRIST, knowing what an eternall waight of glorie, that ſufferance treaſured vp in heauen for them. And if the Aſſerians vpon the ſight of IVDITH's beautie, did comfort themſelues in the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of that ſeige, with the hope they had to enioy the faire crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who were in the Citie. What extreamities of miſeries were we not willingly to endure, to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the ineſtimable felicities, which we haue repreſented? <hi>If by labours,</hi> ſaith S. AVGVSTINE, <hi>it must be atchiued, from this inſtant I inuoke you, ô all yee torments of the world, I coniure you to burst out vpon my head, and shewre downe a mayne vpon me.</hi> Let tribulations be <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and preſſe in troopes vpon me; let
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7957:182"/>infirmities, vexations, pouertie, want, aduerſitie make head against and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe me. Let euery one perſecute me, let all creatures bandie against me; let me be the Butt of all their arrowes, let me be the ſcorne of men, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of people, let my dayes be ended in pinching paines, yet will I bee too content, ſo that after this sharpe winter I may gather the flowres of the eternall Spring, and that I may be rancked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Elect who are bright with beames of Glorie.</hi> I cannot be weaned from the plentifull and yndraynable dugges of this great and fruitefull Doctour, without ſuckinge a long draught, to giue ſome colour and life to this <hi>Draught</hi> of myne. Marke then, how he doth encourage vs to ſufferances for the attayning of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie. <hi>If we diligently ponder the reward that is propoſed vnto vs, all that we ſuffer will ſeeme litle and light, and we shall repute our paines vnworthy of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7957:183"/>ſo great a recompence. For is it not true that we should buy eternall rest at a iuſt Rate, though we were to pay a perpetuall labour for it; and to purchaſe an eternall felicitie at the price of an eternall ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Marrie if you were imployed in an eternall labour, when would you come to an eternall reward? O the eternall Goodneſſe! who hath made our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion temporall, and yet to this paſsing paine, he hath alotted an endleſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Place a thouſand thouſand yeares before-Eternitie, and yet what doe you doe, but compare a limited with an illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited thing? Adde to this, that God did not onely prefixe a certaine tearme to our labours, but that a short one to; for what is the life of man, but the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a few dayes? Though a man therfore were oppreſſed for the whole courſe of his life, with all ſortes of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, labours, greeues; though priſons, hungar, thirst, and irkeſome vlcers should accompaignie him to his graue;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7957:183"/>were it not yet an affliction of a short standing: the dayes of man are few in number, his labours short and light, and yet are followed with an endleſſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with an eternall Beatitude. After theſe short ſufferances, we shall be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Societie of Angells and Saintes, the inheritance of</hi> IESVS CHRIST, <hi>God him ſelfe, an inestimable price for ſo ſmale a labour! Wherfore,</hi> ſaith he in another place, <hi>let vs loue eternall life, and let vs learne how much we are to labour for it, by the exemple of thoſe who doe paſsionately loue this mortall life fearing to looſe it: for when any ſickneſſe begins to threaten them death, what doe they not doe, I doe not ſay to eſcape it, for that, is not poſsible, but onely for a tyme to protract deathes fatall blow? How much doth a man strugle when death doth catch him by the necke, to eſcape out of its clawes, he flies, he hides him ſelf, and giues all that doth poſſeſſe, to keepe his bodie in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7957:184"/>of his ſoule. At the price of all his fortunes he is readie to ranſome his life. If he be feircely ſicke, he freely endures all the paines that the Surgeons putt him to; he obeyes the Doctours order; takes downe the bittereſt pill in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries shope; he nether grugheth price nor paine, ſo he may eſcape the graue: he is willing to conſume all his ſubſtance, to prolonge for ſome few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more, his conſumeing life; and yet to liue eternally how few are willing to endure a litle diſcommoditie? But if worldlings prolonge their miſerable dayes, with ſo much inſtance, vigilancie, precauſion, prodigalitie, paine, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what ought not they to doe, whoſe braue and generous myndes, eye nothing that is leſſe then Eternitie? And if they be eſteemed prudent who ſpare nothing to conſerue a miſerable mortall life, how imprude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt they needs be, who for an immortall one, will vſe no ſort of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce nether againſt their body nor ſoule?</hi>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7957:187"/>labour is required for an endleſſe rest? If you will make a iust valuation, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall labour is due to an eternall peace. T'is true indeede, yet feare not, ô ſoule, God is mercifull; he knowes well, that if thou wert eternally to labour for this pourchaſe, thou shouldſt neuer attayne vnto the promiſſed and deſired reſt; and therfore, that thou mightst attayne it, he will not haue thy labour to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: not that the Eternitie of glorie would not deſerue it; but that thou mighteſt be ſure to beare it. It is worth an eternall, and yet is bought for a temporall labour.</hi> In an other place, the ſame Father, doth enlarge and continue this conſideration. <hi>When eternall life,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is promiſſed vs, let vs place before our eyes, a life exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the tormoyles and troubles which we taſte in this, and thou shalt more happily find out the calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which are not to be found in that bleſſed life, then thou canſt the infinite

This E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie is worth thyſelfe, and yet worth no more then thou art; giue thy ſelfe, and tis thyne. Why doſt thou dodge, why dost thou ſtand vpon the price. Dost thou apprehend, that to make the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou art to be ſold indeed: no thou art not; pay thy ſelfe ſuch as thou art, and the purchaſe is made. Alas I am poore and miſerable, wilt thou ſay, nor shall I be receaued as currant money. But I dare aſſure thee, that in freely giuing thy ſelfe thou wilt become good coyne: for to giue ones ſelfe in confidence of ſuch a promiſſe, is to be good. And

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7957:190"/>But heauenly felicitie is of a more ſolide temper; for (beſides that, according to IOB, <hi>the heauens are build of moſt ſolide braſſe;</hi> and are compoſed of a matter which weares not a way, being exempt from all corruption or alteration) the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of glorie, which is promiſed to the Elect, is equall to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of God, who shall neuer haue end.

               <p>I Could here expreſſe many wholſome effectes, which this thought of Eternitie cauſeth in thoſe, who doe frequently, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ruminate it in their hearts.

For what archer can hitt a marke, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ayming at it; and ſince all this life is but an introduction to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, how should one poſſibly arriue there, vnleſſe he begin tymely to tend towards it, and addreſſe all his ſtepps and actions to that end. If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Agent doe worke for ſome end; and if our principall and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne end conſiſte in our eternall vnion with God in glorie, ought we not in this mortall life to take the path, which doth conduct vs to this end?

All thoſe that doe handle ſpirituall

And the Pſalmiſt, I haue done Iudgement and Iuſtice, becauſe I dreaded the irreuocable ſentence of the Almightie. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as there is nothing which doth ſo ſpeedily free a feild of rootes and rubbidge, as the application of fire to the brambles and vndergroth, wherby it becomes thornie and wilde; ſo nothing doth cauſe a man more quickly to renounce vice; nor more efficaciouſly purge the ſoule, then the horrour of eternall fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the diuell and his Angells.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7957:195"/>This is to put the hatchet to the roote of the bad tree, leaſt it might bring forth the fruites of corruption.

               <p>HItherto, Athanaſia, we haue not giuen thee a ſtraight and cleare, but an indirect view of Eternitie; we haue shewen it thee onely ſideling, as BALAAM beheld the armie of Iſrael: we haue onely pondered the two armes therof, not the bodie: It's effects onely, not it's cauſe; and, as one would ſay, we haue ſeene the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers onely, not the face; the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, not the ſubſtance therof. For albeit the Diuines teach vs, that it is a whole and perfect poſſeſſion, of an endleſſe life, yet doth not this deſcription quiet my vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, in that it doth not represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Eternitie as a thing created, and out of God; and which being applyed to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, will indeede haue no end, yet
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7957:200"/>preſuppoſeth a begining; God alone being truely eternall; that is, without begining or end: he being the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining and end, of all that hath beeing by participation of his. But now, Athanaſia, I will propoſe vnto you the <hi>eſſentiall Eternitie,</hi> which is no other thing then God himſelfe. And God too, not as punishing in the Eternitie accurſed, nor as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding in the bleſſed Eternitie, but as being in himſelfe, as his owne eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to his owne Eternitie: and that true increated and eſſentiall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, in which this created Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie conſiſteth, wherof we haue shewen ſome <hi>strokes</hi> before. O what an Eternitie is this, Athanaſia, and whither is the flight of my thoughts carried, ſince it toucheth vpon the glorie of the Diuine Maieſtie, in the higheſt regions? Here it is, that the winge and ſight of an Eagle, were required, to rayſe ones ſelfe vp
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7957:201"/>into the highneſſe of the riches, and wiſdome of God, who is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible in all his wayes. And to behold this Sunne of the Eaſt, which is the fountaine of all light, and which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be obſcured. And here, not the blacke and darke <hi>lynes</hi> of a firſt <hi>Draught,</hi> but euen the bright rayſes of the Sunne, were more then requiſite, to bring light and life to the deciphering of him, who from all Eternitie, doth inhabite an inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſable light, and who could not be ſuſteyned by a created vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, vnleſſe it were fortified with the <hi>light of Glorie.</hi> All thoſe Diuine perfections, which Diuinitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders in God, vnder the name of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,</hi> are in him, his owne onely and incompoſed Eſſence: for being a pure Act, he doth not admitt in himſelfe any compoſition at all; or multiplicitie of qualities, being all Eſſence, all ſubſtance. But we are
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7957:201"/>conſtrayned by our owne infirmitie to ſpeake ſo of God, according to our ordinarie manner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaueing and diſcourſeing: calling him <hi>Good, Iuste, Mercifull, Infinite, Eternall, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi> as we doe diuerſly caſt our thoughts vpon his workes, rather then vpon himſelfe, who in his one and onely beeing, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend, by way of eminencie, all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are found in <hi>Goodnes, Iustice, Mercy.</hi> So that he is not onely eſſentially good, but he is euen eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Goodneſſe, all that is good being good by the onely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and participation of this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Goodneſſe. Now to giue a name to this ſupreme excellencie, is a worke proper to the ſame excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, which as it alone doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know it ſelfe, ſo it onely is able to name it ſelfe. Whervpon the Angell ſpeaking vnto SAMSON's Father, and repreſenting vnto him
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7957:202"/>the Diuine Maieſtie, ſaid: why doſt thou inquire my name which is ADMIRABLE, that is, which thou canſt not conceaue, but by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Howbeit, amongſt the multitude of Diuine names, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the holy Scripture is full; and which the bookes of the Doctours of the Church propoſe vnto vs, there is none more generally receaued, then that, which God by his owne mouth imparted vnto MOYSES, who demanded his name, that he might denounce it to ſuch as should inquire after it. I AM WHO AM, ſaid our Lord; and if they aske thee who ſent thee vnto them, tell them, he that IS commanded me to come vnto you. This name, IS, ſaith the Angell of the ſchoole, is the moſt proper of all the Diuine names, as being the moſt ſignificatiue; for it doth not expreſſe any forme at all, but onely a ſimple <hi>beeing;</hi> or rather
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7957:202"/>the <hi>beeing</hi> of <hi>beeings,</hi> as that great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of nature tearmed it. And God being his owne <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Beeing,</hi> cannot be more properly named then by the name IS: which cauſed S. IOHN DAMASCENE to ſay, that the principall name of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine names, is, He who IS, becauſe he is as an infinite Ocean, an illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſubſtance. Againe, this name ſutes well with God, in that, it doth expreſſe a continuall preſent tyme, which doth shew the eſſentiall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie of God, in whom, ſaith S. AVGVSTINE, in his bookes of the Trinitie, there is nether tyme paſt, nor tyme to come. Now this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is ſo eſſentiall to God, that if he were not eternall, he would ceaſe to be God: and that created Eternitie, wherof Diuines ſpeake, doth onely ſubſiſte in the increated Eternitie of God himſelfe, and, if we may ſo ſay, it is imperfect; for though it shall
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7957:203"/>neuer haue end, being a continuall <hi>prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> without any meaſure of tyme; yet had it a begining, ſince God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, of all the things which haue <hi>beeing,</hi> hath no begining. Nor doe we ſee any title in holy Scripture more frequently attributed vnto God, then that he is <hi>Eternall.</hi> I liue <hi>eternally</hi> ſaith our Lord. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is <hi>eternall.</hi> Our Lord is great <hi>eternally.</hi> Our Lord is ſeated in an <hi>eternall</hi> Throne. God is not moued <hi>eternally.</hi> Thoſe that hope in him shall not be confounded <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</hi> The name of his Maieſtie is <hi>Eternall.</hi> He is his Elect's <hi>eternall</hi> part. Mercy is eſtablished <hi>eternally</hi> in Heauen. His Word and Truth shall dure <hi>eternally.</hi> He hath made an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> Teſtament. God is liuing and <hi>Eternall</hi> for euer and euer. He is an <hi>Eternall</hi> Dominatour. He doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the <hi>eternall</hi> Hieruſalem. His powre is an <hi>eternall</hi> powre, and his
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7957:203"/>Kingdome in generation and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And many the like paſſages all through the holy Scripture. Now, he is not onely eternall, but is euen the very eternall Eſſence, or the ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTIALL ETERNITIE. So that to thinke of Eternitie, is to haue God for the onely obiect of our thoughtes. And to applie the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our immortall ſoule, to his eſſence, who alone of himſelfe hath immortalitie, is it not the perfection and fulneſſe of our eſſentiall Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude? If therfore, I extolle the thought of Eternitie aboue all other thoughtes, by reaſon of that great &amp; infinite Obiect, am I not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon a ſolide reaſon? Is not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſitie, and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable perfection therof able to rauish and drinke vp all our interiour and exteriour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? following that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My heart and my flesh haue reioyced toward the liuing God.</hi>

In him they haue the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie and beautie of ſundrie ſeaſons, the freshneſſe of the Springe; the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Sommer: the fruitfulneſſe of the fall of the leafe; the reſt and repoſe of winter: In fine all that which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light their ſenſes, or ſolace the faculties of their ſoule.

To be short, thoſe shadowes of good, which are ſcattered ouer terreane things, as droppes of dew, and are diſtributed rarely and onely by parcells, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in God, and as it were in an infinite Ocean. If fleeting toyes

If this mortall and created life be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, how precious shall he be, who hath not onely life in himſelfe, but who is life it ſelfe, and <hi>in whom we liue and are.</hi> If the acquaintance of perfect creatures be ſo pleaſing a thing: how much more ſweete is the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Creatour, which is ſo compleate, and the very modell of all perfection? If theſe fading earthly beauties be ſo gayning and engaging: how rauishing shall his beautie be, which is admired by the Sunne and Moone, and in whoſe preſence the ſtarrs are not bright? If the antiquitie of nobilitie haue ſuch a rate put vpon it, by the vanitie of thoſe that doe adore it; how much

If worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and fortunes be courted by ſo many, how much more is he to be ſued for and purſued, whoſe houſe is replenished <hi>with glorie and riches.</hi> For if it be he who made all things good, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated vnto them, all that is delightfull or wishfull in them, muſt we not infallibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade our ſelues, that he reſerued the excellencie therof for himſelfe, but an excellencie which doth infinitly ſurpaſſe all that we are able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. <hi>What happineſſe,</hi> ſaith S.

There, the Elect peaceably enioying a ſacred repoſe, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Saboath, shall ſee how ſweete our Lord is, being filld with him, who shall be in them all that can be deſired. O my God, thou art my deare Truth, my true Eternitie, my eternall felicitie!

Let vs therfore goe with confidence to the Throne of his Grace, if we deſire to haue part in his Glorie. Let vs permit
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7957:209"/>him to wash the feete of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, if we will with S. PETER, haue Societie with him.

This loue did once vnite the Diuine and humane nature in the Perſon of the WORD; and did ſo farre <hi>exinanite</hi> the eternall Sonne of the eternall Father, as to become man, to take vpon him <hi>the forme of a ſeruant;</hi> to appeare in earth, and to be conuerſant with men. A loue which may well rayſe man towards God, ſince it could bring God downe to man.

It is this Diuine Loue, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating our affections, not onely from dangerous and ſuperfluous things, but euen from things which are not euil, yet are ſubiect to be loued with exceſſe, and with too ſtrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate a paſſion, shall make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all created things in God; and will ſo gouerne our inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that we shall affect no creature but in God, for God, and according to God: wherin conſiſteth the perfect pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that Diuine Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, which commands vs to loue God with all our heart, with all our ſoule, with all our ſpirit, with all our ſtrength, and euen aboue all things. For a ſoule that is come to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7957:210"/>of perfection, that she loues nothing but in God, and God in all things: in proper ſpeach, loues not many things, nor is not in the folici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude inſeparable from the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of louely obiects, but she loues but one onely thing, which is God, <hi>the one true neceſſarie thing,</hi> and out of whom all is but miſerie and <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of spirit.</hi> And becauſe in all that which the order of Charitie propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto her to be loued, she loues God alone, she loues him equally in all, and as couragiouſly in her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly in her friend; becauſe she loues him onely out of all other things, and without all other things, but nothing at all without him, or out of him. <hi>If it be</hi> ESTHER <hi>alone that</hi> ASSVERVS <hi>loueth,</hi> ſaith my bleſſed Father in his Theotime, <hi>why should he loue her more when she is parfumed and adorned, then when she is in her comon attire? If it be our Sauiour onely
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7957:210"/>that a ſoule loueth, why should she not as well loue the Mount-Caluarie, as Thabor, ſith he is as truly in the one as the other: and why should she not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce as cordially in the one as in the other; It is Good for vs to be here. She can loue our Sauiour in Egipt without louing Egipt; why then shall she not loue him in the banquet of</hi> SIMON <hi>the</hi> LEPROVS, <hi>without louing the banquet? And if she loue him amidſt the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which are vomited out against him without louing the blasphemies, why shall she not loue him parfumed with</hi> MAGDELAINES <hi>precious oyntments; without louing the parfumes or ſmells? It is a true ſigne that one loues God onely in all things, when one loues him equally in all things, ſince he being alwayes equall to himſelfe, the inequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of loue towards him, must needs ſpring from ſome thing which is not he. Whence the ſoule that loues God purely and ſingulary, loues him no more with
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7957:211"/>the whole vniuerſe to boote, then all alone without the vniuerſe, becauſe all that which is out of God, and is not God, is as nothing to her. O pure ſoule! who loues not euen Paradice it ſelfe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is there loued: and is ſo ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignely loued in his Paradice, as, that if he had not a Paradice to bestow, yet would he nether be leſſe loulie, or leſſe beloued of this generous ſoule, who knowes not how to loue the Paradice of her God, but onely her God of Paradice, and who puts no leſſe rate vpon the Caluarie where her Sauiour was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then the Heauen where he is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> O how well doth this ſaintly Bishope ſpeake, my Athanaſia, whoſe tearmes I durſt not para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe; nor diſguiſe or change his venerable words, leaſt I might looſe his deuoute se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe, expreſſed in words of ſo great energie, and ſo full of ſpirit and vertue, that all the flanting tearmes of <hi>worldly wiſdome,</hi> ſeeme to

How forcibly and ſweetly doth he teach vs in this diſcourſe not to looke vpon the two hands of God, that of Iuſtice and vengance, and that other of Mercy and reward, but to <hi>ſearch after his face alone;</hi> and to feare and loue him for himſelfe, not for the punishments which he threatens vice; nor for the reward, which he propoſeth to vertue: becauſe he is altogether to be honored, worshiped and ſerued for the loue of him ſelfe, yea although he had nether Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice for reward, nor yet Hell for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. The bleſſed and accurſed Eternitie, are onely to be conſidered as things acceſſorie. Our prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and cheife attention are to be ſet vpon the Diuine Eternitie, or the eternall Diuinitie, vnleſſe we would looſe the title of the <hi>children of God,</hi> and through feare of eternall punishments, or deſire of eternall
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7957:212"/>rewards beeſteemed ſlaues and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relings. Let's loue God, Athanaſia, and let him diſpoſe of vs as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Let vs be in his hands, as clay in the hand of the Potter. Let him make of vs <hi>veſſells of honour or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie.</hi> Be it nobly or ignobly, ſo we be his, it ſufficeth. Lets turne our eyes from rewards or punishments, and let vs fixe them vpon our Lord. <hi>Let vs behold his amiable face.</hi> Let vs ſet our view vpon his hands, but as a faithfull hand-maide vpon thoſe of her Miſtriſſe. Let vs receaue indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently that which comes from the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of proſperitie, and the left of aduerſitie. Although he should euen kill vs, lets hope in him. And let vs hope without hope, yea euen againſt all apparence, that nothing shall ſeparate vs from his Charitie. Let vs caſt all our thoughtes vpon him. And in ſteed of ſtaying our thoughtes vpon the created, and as
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7957:212"/>it were, the <hi>accidentall Eternitie,</hi> of Heauen or Hell, let vs onely be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened vpon the <hi>eſſentiall Eternitie</hi> which is God himſelfe, who hath in his hand the extreamities of the earth. And who keepes the keyes of eternall life and death. Let vs not ſo dwell vpon the thought of Heauen or Hell's Eternitie, as that we doe not more thinke of his Eternitie who made them both; this, for the Diuells and their aſſociates; that, for the Angells and the Elect. O eternall Diuinitie! ô Diuine Eternitie! thou art he whom I conſider, and whom I ſeake for; to thee onely it is that I aſpire: for without thee, the created Eternitie would not bee, ſince it doth not ſubſiſte but by the eternall eſſence of the eſſentiall Eternitie, which is no other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himſelfe. And yet further to puriſie myne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and bring it to its full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, henceforth I will not ſo much

And if, by the imagination of an impoſſible thing, one could be in Hell with his grace, his accurſed Eternitie would not be dreadfull: nor is the Bleſſed Eternitie to be deſired, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life is <hi>to ſee God eternally,</hi> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon him.

               <head type="sub">LXXIV.</head>
               <p>IT is not all to ſow, Athanaſia, but the principale thing is to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7957:217"/>reape the crope. The <hi>Theorie</hi> is faire, like vnto RACHEL, but yet bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine: but the <hi>Practiſe</hi> is fertile, like LIA, though leſſe agreeable in the eye. It is not enough to make ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpeculations: vnleſſe our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doe anſweare vnto them, all is worth nothing: yea they ſerue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduentures to leade vs into ruine; <hi>for the ſeruant that knowes the will of his Maister, and doth it not, shall be bett with many stripes.</hi> All that ſay Lord, Lord, shall not enter into glorie, but thoſe that shall obſerue the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Fathers Commandements. To enter into the Marriage of the Lambe, it is not enough to haue the Lampes lighted, but there muſt be oyle in them too. Hell is full of the <hi>chaffe</hi> of good deſires: but the Granarie of Heauen, receaues onely the <hi>wheate</hi> of good workes. Let vs deſcend therfore to the Practiſe, before we ſound the retreate; and let vs put the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:7957:217"/>laſt ſinger to this DRAVGHT by ſpirituall <hi>endeauours,</hi> wherby to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print deeply in our heartes, this wholſome memorie of Eternitie, be it the Bleſſed, accurſed, or Eſſentiall. It is reported that the great TAMER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANE, who in his tyme was the ſcourge of God, and the terrour of the world, was wont in Camping himſelfe before a Towne (which shut the Gates, and reſolued to withſtand the dreadfull forces of his troopes) to put out the firſt day of the Seige <hi>a white Bannar,</hi> in ſigne of pardon, mildneſſe and mercy, in caſe they should freely re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der themſelues vp into his hands. The ſecond day he cauſed <hi>a reade one</hi> be hung out, to ſignifie that in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition, ſome of them should pay for it. But the third day he ſet out <hi>a black one,</hi> as a ſigne of his indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to proteſt vnto them, that there was no place left to Clemencie; but that taking
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7957:218"/>the Towne by force, he would offer vp all the inhabitants victimes to DEATH, without all reſpect to age or ſexe. Theſe three colours, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſia, wherwith DRAVGHTES are made (for ordinarily they are minuted vpon white paper with vermillion and blacke) doe represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto vs, thoſe three ſtandarts, and the reference which they haue to the three ſorts of Eternities, which I haue deciphered vnto you. <hi>The white,</hi> as the ground, doth put before your eyes the <hi>Eſſentiall Eternitie,</hi> which is the proper eſſence of God, the eternall fundation of all created Eternitie. If we deliuer our ſelues vp to his loue and milde Clemencie, we may confidently expect from this <hi>ſo ſweete a God to them that ſeeke him,</hi> that white ſtone promiſed to the Elect in the Apocalipſe, which shall be <hi>a better marke</hi> of the reward of eternall ſaluation, to ſuch as haue
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:7957:218"/>whitened their ſoule <hi>in the blood of the Lambe. The rede colour,</hi> which conteynes light in it, and is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Roſe, doth prefigure vnto vs the <hi>Bleſſed Eternitie,</hi> where the <hi>Roſes doe neuer fade;</hi> and where the Elect behold the light of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie in the <hi>light of Glorie.</hi> But withall this bloodie colour doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that none arriues at this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, but <hi>by the price of the blood of the Lambe;</hi> and <hi>that through the fire and water of many tribulations and ſufferances, They shall be ſaued,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, <hi>yet as by the fire,</hi> of anguishes and labours. But alas how nakedly doth the <hi>black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> a colour of mourning, ſadneſſe, and night, repreſent, that <hi>accurſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie;</hi> wherin, are <hi>exteriour darknes,</hi> without all hope of day; where are <hi>gnashings of teeth,</hi> and the reſt of the Calamities, which rudely and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely we haue drawen. O Athanaſia,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:7957:219"/>to th'end that thoſe bannars, no leſſe daunting then the Archangell's tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet; or rather, to th'end that that which they repreſent, may neuer depart out of our view: and that this thought may not be blotted out of our ſoule, make a full reſolution to exerciſe your ſelfe in the enſuing Practiſes. Sithens <hi>Habits</hi> are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in vs, according to all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, but by often iterated <hi>Actes.</hi> If your heart be truely touched with a deſire of eternall ſaluation, it will be like vnto the Saylers needle tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a Loadſtone, which turnes continually towards the North, ſo your thoughtes will inceſſantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect themſelues towards Eternitie; now, towards the Bleſſed; now, towards the Accurſed; now, towards the eſſentiall, this laſt imbracing the two former, as the Firmament the inferiour Spheares. And though the methode which I am about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:7957:219"/>vnto you, to helpe to ſtay your mynd vpon this Obiect, may ſeeme at the firſt ſight verie ſimple, I would aduiſe you, not to diſpiſe it for all that, as did NAAMAN at firſt the aduiſe of the Prophete, to wash himſelfe ſeauen tymes in Iorden, if he would be deliuered of his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie. Call to mynd, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sacramentes, which are the inſtrumentes of Diuine graces, is verie ſimple and common, yet vnder the vaile of ſo ſlender appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, ly hid, the infinite treaſures of wiſdome and Goodnes. Why, euen the Scripture it ſelfe ſends vs to Piſmires, litle birds and flowres to gather from them profitable leſſons and inſtructions. Take then for your <hi>first</hi> PRACTISE (if I may haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife with you, that which hath brought a wonderfull profit to ſome ſoules of myne acquaintance) to thinke as often of Eternitie, as you
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:7957:220"/>heare the cloke ſtrike, night or day. Let this ſound put you in mynd, that ſtepp by ſtepp you doe ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to your end, that by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible progreſſe you drawe neere your graue; which ought to be the Gate of Eternitie. And then ſoaring in ſpirit beyond tranſitorie things, which doe vanish as a shade, aſpire to that bleſſed Eternitie, not ſubiect to the meaſure of tyme, which is the courſe of the Sunne or the PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVM MOBILE, and ſay: when shall my feete be eſtablished vpon the liuely Rocke, that my ſtepps may no more ſlide, and that the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament being as a pauement, I may walke vpon the face of the ſtarrs. This will come to paſſe, my Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſia, if you doe carefully, and duely, manage the houres and moments, of which we are about to ſpeake: and if, while tyme ſerues, you will doe good deedes, which doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:7957:220"/>and bring vs to Eternitie.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>ſecond</hi> PRACTISE take thoſe three tymes, The morning, Noonetyde, and Euening, wherof DAVID makes mention, ſaying: In the <hi>euening, morning,</hi> and the <hi>midſt of the day,</hi> I was myndfull of God. And to helpe your memorie, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to the ANGELVS DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINI BELL, which doth admonish vs to recite three tymes the Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angell, in honour of the Miſterie of the Incarnation of the Sonne of God: and ioyne to this pious cuſtome the memorie of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by thinking, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall became mortall, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall for your ſaluation did ſubiect himſelfe to <hi>Tyme,</hi> in vniting his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie to our humanitie. How good occaſion doth this deſcent of the Sonne of God into earth adminiſter vnto you, to rayſe vp your ſelfe to Heauen, and there to ſeeke <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:7957:221"/>Citie</hi> for euer, in the holy Sion. Vndertake this holy exerciſe by taske, and for the ſpace of ſome dayes; to th'end that cuſtome may beget in you a habite, frequently to thinke of Eternitie.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>third</hi> PRACTISE: oblige your ſelfe by a firme pourpoſe (yet without vow) to ſay euery day at ſome houre moſt comodious for you, three PATER NOSTER's. And in reciting them, to thinke of the Bleſſed, accurſed, and eſſentiall Eternitie, which is God. Vniting your ſelfe to the laſt by Loue: by deſire to the Bleſſed: deteſting the accurſed, rather by the correction of your manners, and amendment of life, then by emptie words. For as we come not to the celeſtiall Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie without <hi>doing good;</hi> ſo we auoyd not the accurſed, but by <hi>flying euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you recite your beades, or the Crowne of our Bleſſed Lady, a
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7957:221"/>prayer very familiar to all thoſe who make profeſſion of pietie. Let this crowne of flowres, put you in mynd of the flowres, which neuer fade, wherof the Garland of Eternitie is wrought. Let the round forme of this Crowne make you myndfull, that the Sphearicall figure which hath nether begining nor end, is the Symbole of the eſſentiall Eternitie, which neuer had begining, nor shall euer haue end. This you may vſe as a <hi>fourth</hi> PRACTISE.</p>
               <p>None can liue like a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who doth not twice a day, at leaſt, wind vp the Cloke of his heart, and thinke of his wayes, to witt, <hi>in the morning and euening:</hi> Theſe are two tymes, which he that deſires to liue according to God, and to direct his footſteps in the pathes of Peace, ought neuer to omitt. Take then ſome litle part of that tyme, to caſt a looke vpon Eternitie, that totall
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:7957:222"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance, which is neuer followed with euening nor morning. And beſeech God Almightie, that you may ſo paſſe through temporall, that you may not looſe eternall things. This shall be a <hi>fift</hi> PRACTISE for you. Lets paſſe to</p>

               <p>THere is nothing ſo frequent in the mouth of Chriſtians, Athanaſia, as the Prayer which our Lord and Maiſter made to direct vs to his heauenly Father, according to his words and ſpirit, to thend that hauing his will in our mouth, we might be heard <hi>for the reuerence of it.</hi> If you will beleeue me, as often as this holy Prayer shall paſſe through your lipps, you shall call to mynd the <hi>Eſſentiall Eternitie</hi> by apprehending that you ſpeake to

               <p> Vpon feſtiuall days, whether it be of the myſteries of our holy Fayth, or of the ſolemnities of our Sauiour IESVS, of his holy mother, or of Saintes, can we be imployed in a better thought, then with the deſire of imitating them, to meet them in Eternitie, by walking in the pathes which they haue marked vs out? For in vaine should we boaſt that we are <hi>members of</hi> IESVS CHRIST, and <hi>children of Saints, if we refuſe to walke as they haue walked;</hi> that ſo following their example, we may come to <hi>be made worthy vnto the part of the lot of Saintes in the light</hi> of eternall felicitie. Vpon worke dayes, which the Church Office calls <hi>ferialls,</hi> we are to thinke, that none comes to the eternall <hi>Ferialls</hi> but by labours and ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.

The beautie of Townes and Palaces doth preſently repreſent vnto her the riches of the incomparable Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, ſuch as it is deſcribed in the Apocalipſe; and that Palace of the Diuinitie far other then that of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID and SALOMON, which the Scripture doth ſo richly deſcribe. An old Hermite beholding the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane TRIVMPHES in their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificall Pompe: what shall the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Hieruſalem be, quoth he, if ſuch ſplendour and glorie be ſeene euen in earth? <hi>O Lord,</hi> will we ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>how happie are they that liue in thy houſe,</hi> far beyond thoſe that liue <hi>in the Tabernacles of Sinners!
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:7957:231"/>O how goodly are the Tentes of</hi> IACOB for euer! how the Manſions in the houſe of the Heauenly Father, are diuerſified, and deſireable! How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable are thy Porches, <hi>ô Lord God of Vertue's</hi> my ſoule is tranſported in conſideration therof!</p>
               <p>Theſe worldly magnificencies which we dayly ſee, ought to be ſo many ladders to a good ſoule, to aſcend to thoſe that are eternall, which are onely to be found in his Abode, who is <hi>great and laudible in his holy Citie, and his eternall Hill,</hi> whoſe greatnes is infinite. The ſight of humane miſeries will make the like impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her by ſending her downe <hi>to Hell aliue,</hi> to behold there, calamities incomparably greater, in their extremitie, and eternall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. Yea if she behold malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours led to execution by humane Iuſtice, it makes her thinke of the eternall Iuſtice of God, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:7957:232"/>vpon the damned, without all hope of eaſe or deliuerie. Nay if she doe but ſee a beaſt die, she is moued to pittie thoſe poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whoſe Felicitie expires with their life.</p>
               <p>If she take into her conſideration the great ones of this world, that which is written occurs vnto her mynd, that <hi>the Powrefull shall be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrefully torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted.</hi> In beholding Kings and Princes she doth rather pittie then enuie their condition, when she calls to mynd, that <hi>they shall die like other men.</hi> That all <hi>their glorie shall paſſe as the floure of the feild;</hi> and that their Diademes and honours of ſo short ſtanding, hath nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that Kingdome, where the King of Kings raignes with his Elect, whom he makes participant of his Royaltie, but a Royaltie that is euerlaſting, a Kingdome that knowes no end.</p>
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:7957:232"/>
               <p> If she caſt her ey downe vpon the poore and litle ones, who are here below the refuſe of the world, and the ſcorne of men, she appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds them happie, becauſe to them, as to a poore LAZARVS, an eternall Kingdome is promiſed.</p>
               <p>If warre and peace occurre vnto her thoughtes, they doe forthwith draw with them the memorie of both the Eternities. The accurſed, where there is a continuall warre without Peace: The Bleſſed, where there raynes a happie Peace without all feare of warre. Yea hereby, she falls vpon the Eſſence of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally great God, who in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is ſometymes ſtyled the God of Peace, ſometymes the God of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and reuenge.</p>
               <p>The ſight of the Sea, floodes, riuers, and fountaines, make her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſame: for she thinkes of the fountaine of Paradice, of the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:7957:233"/>ſource of life ſpringing towards E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie; she thinkes of the flood of the Citie of God, and of the infinite Ocean of the eſſentiall Eternitie, of the eternall eſſence: whoſe is the Sea, ſaith DAVID, and who made this vaſte receptacle of waters.</p>
               <p>In what eſtate ſoeuer, a ſoule that is ſeaſoned with this holy exerciſe, be, whether in proſperitie or aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, in ioy or greefe, in conſolation or deſolation, in priuation or frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in pleaſure or paine, in ſicknes or health be she in grace or diſgrace with the world, in plentie or want, be it amidſt riches, or in the preſſe of pouertie, <hi>all doth cooperate to good.</hi> And all this placeth Eternitie before her eyes, beholding the accurſed, in afflictions; the bleſſed, in content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the eternall God in euery thing, &amp; euery thing in the eternall God. To whom keeping an inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable fidelitie, in the various change
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:7957:233"/>of things, she pronounceth coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly with the Apoſtle, <hi>whether we liue or die we are our Lord's.

Exerciſe your ſelfe therfore frequently and faithfully in this Practiſe of Aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Iaculatorie Prayers, which are ſo familiar to all thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe true pietie: and you will find by experience, that as by meanes therof you come to ſee God in all

               <p>O God, Athanaſia, what am I about to ſay, this Eternitie which shall neuer haue end, is not yet, in reſpect of vs, without begining, and it is that which the Diuines call <hi>Euiternitie;</hi> for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, being his owne Eternitie, is
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:7957:234"/>without begining or end. But all other creatures who were made in TYME had a begining; yet true it is that both Angells and men shall be eternall, marrie, in the tyme to come, for they had a begining, and were not from all Eternitie. Now as we haue had a begining, and shall haue no end, (whether our wicked life doe precipitate vs into eternall punishments; or our good endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, aſſiſted by God's grace, make vs a way to eternall life.) So our paſſage to the bleſſed or accurſed Eternitie, depends of <hi>a moment</hi> as of its principle. O Athanaſia, how at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue ought we to be to vnderſtand that dreadfull moment whervpon depends our Eternitie. If you aske me which it is, I will diſcouer vnto you, in the next <hi>ſtroke,</hi> that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the moments of this mortall life. But as in a plentious heruiſt, there are alwayes ſome eares
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:7957:235"/>of come more notable then the reſt; and amongſt the ſtarrs, thoſe which are neereſt the two Poles are the moſt remarkable; ſo amongſt the moments of which our mortall life are compoſed, I would wish that we should haue a principall care of the two, of which I am about to ſpeake. The firſt is the precious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which the Diuine grace doth touch our hearts, called by the Scripture the <hi>tyme of our viſitation,</hi> a moment of ſuch importance, that being rightly receaued, it is the blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of our bleſſed Eternitie, but being ill managed, it is the begining of our accurſed Eternitie. Woe be to thee, ſaid our Sauiour weeping, ô Hieruſalem, becauſe thou haſt not <hi>decerned the tyme of thy viſitation.</hi> O God, Athanaſia, how we shall be aſtonished, when before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of the iuſt Iudge, where we muſt all appeare, we shall heare our
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:7957:235"/>ſelues accuſed of ſo many negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for that we haue ether deſpiſed the Diuine inſpirations, or that we haue abuſed ſo many heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly graces which <hi>could haue giuen vs life,</hi> if we had bene deade by ſinne; <hi>or life more abundantly,</hi> if we were alreadie in grace; according as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How much was that ſlothfull louer of the Canticles greeued, when she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that her Spouſe was paſt by, who had ſtood at her Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber doore quaking with cold and beſeeching entrie by ſo many louing inuitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and aduantagous promiſſes? She riſeth, but to late; she runs full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation into diuers places, but fines him not, till after a thouſand and a thouſand labours, affrontes, &amp; repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But what a heart breake shall it be to the reprobate ſoule, when after her condemnation she shall clearly ſee, how many occaſions of working her ſaluation she had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected;
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:7957:236"/>and how many meanes she had to free her ſelfe from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which she shall ſee her ſelfe adiudged for euer? <hi>We ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nſeleſſe,</hi> ſay the damned ſpeaking of the Elect, <hi>eſteemed their life</hi> (who wrought their owne ſaluation) <hi>madnes,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, daſterous and dishonorable, but now we ſee, their <hi>lot is</hi> in the inheritance of <hi>Saintes.</hi> On the other ſide, what a conſolation shall it be to thee Bleſſed, when they shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that their well imployed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of affliction in earth, had wrought in them <hi>an eternall waight of Glorie.</hi> Let vs, therfore be carefull of our ſelues, Athanaſia, Let vs marke what our Sauiour ſpeakes in our hearts, and doubtleſſe we shall vnderſtand words of Peace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth him, and watcheth at his doores dayly,</hi> which we doe, when we are earefull to gather vp his inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:7957:236"/>as the dropes of a heauenly dew which begets precious Pearles in our hearts, and the holy vnions of our ſoule with God. Let's ſtill be on foote, and as it were, ſtand Sentinell vpon our wayes; let vs thinke in what ſort we walke; let vs turne our feete into the <hi>Pathes of the Diuine Lawe.</hi> The SECOND MOMENT is that which makes a ſeparation bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt our ſoule and our body, that is, the inſtant of our departure out of this life, a moment which is our laſt, and is to be iudge of all thoſe that went before. For as the Tree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes for euer where it falls; ſo shall we continue for euer in the, ſtate in which we are found in the inſtant of our death. And ſuch as God shall find vs then, ſuch will he iudge vs. For if all this life be but a waying to Eternitie, death is to be tearmed the doore of Eternitie, yet a double doore, paſſing the good to

Athanaſia, I leaue to your meditation, the reſt of this horrible ſentence, which in the twinkling of an eye shall be put in execution, ingeniouſly confeſſing vnto you, that my quakeing pen doth fall from its flight; as did the birds of old, which flew ouer the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed lake of Pentapolis. But lets turne our eyes from this tragicall ſpectacle, let's giue an attentiue eare to the ſweete voice of the Spouſe of the elected foule. ô how delightfull shall this voice be, and how iuſtly
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:7957:246"/>may the Elect ſay with the Pſalmiſt, ô how ſweete is thy word, ô Lord, to our taſte, yea, it is more ſweete then the honie combe.

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:7957:247"/>which shall transforme the Bleſſed into God, participating of his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and shall tranſlate them into the inheritance of the children of the eternall Father. <hi>Come yee bleſſed,</hi> ô be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction far paſſing that of the old Patriarkes, and which conteynes in it the fatnes of the wishfull ſoyle, and all the dewe of Heauen, quite putting downe the dewe of Hermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which doth diſperſe it ſelfe all ouer the Mountaine of Sion.

This is a miſerable ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the right way. Our life is lent vs to breath after Eternitie.
